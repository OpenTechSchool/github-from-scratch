Now that you have some files and made lots of changes to them let's have a closer look on the "journal" that we talked about before.

#### Challenge
Find the commit history of your repository, review changes and add comments to them.


#### How to do it

Above your list of files, there is a colored bar. And above that, there are some numbers.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/history-1.png)

You can click on those â€“ click on the one labeled "commits".

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/history-2.png)

There it is. Here every change you made to any file is listed. Every change was recorded as a "commit". Remember that word, it is important :)

"Commit" is both a noun and a verb. We already mentioned how *what was changed* in a file is written in a commit. You *made* those commits. You *committed* those changes to your *repository*.

Now these commits have odd names like `579c7a069d0`. *Do* ask why these names are so weird, but ask later. For now just remember that these are called *hashes*.

Click on one of those commit hashes:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/history-3.png)

You will be taken to a new site, where all the information about that change is: a *commit message* for example or the exact lines of code that where changed, how they looked before and how they look now.

Move the cursor over a line of code and a little bubble appears to the left:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/history-5.png)

Click on it and you can leave a comment:

If you have a peer, go to his repository and leave a comment in his code. Say something nice. Whenever someone comments on your history, you will be notified by GitHub per email.
